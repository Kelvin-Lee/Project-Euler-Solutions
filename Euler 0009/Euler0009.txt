// This one can be solved without the aid of programming. 
// If we can find a pythagorean triplet {x, y, z} such that
// (x + y + z) divides 1000, then we can simply multiple the
// three numbers by the appropriate factor, and use those to
// find the desired product.

// Although finding the triplets could be its own exercise,
// through research or memorization, we can recognize that
// 8, 15, and 17 make up a pythagorean triplet. Their sum
// is 40. Because 1000/40 = 25, then our desired pythgorean
// triplet is (8 * 25), (15 * 25), and (17 * 25).

// The product of this is (25^3)*(8)*(15)*(17) = 31875000.
